Guitar Modulation Detection
This project is a machine learning-based system that detects guitar modulation effects (e.g., chorus, flanger, vibrato, Wah, tremolo) in an input audio file. By analyzing the unique characteristics of each modulation effect, this project can help musicians, audio engineers, and enthusiasts identify and classify modulation effects used in a guitar recording.



Overview
The primary goal of this project is to detect various modulation effects applied to a guitar recording, including effects like chorus, flanger, tremolo, and vibrato. Modulation effects change the character of a guitarâ€™s tone by modulating certain aspects of the audio signal, such as pitch or amplitude. By using the LibROSA library for feature extraction and a machine learning model for classification, this system identifies the modulation effect based on audio features.

Features
Detects and classifies common guitar modulation effects.
Processes audio files to extract relevant audio features.
Supports various modulation effects: chorus, flanger, tremolo, and vibrato.
Generates a probability score for each effect class.
Easy-to-use interface for testing on custom audio files.


Data Processing
The project uses LibROSA to process audio files and extract features such as chroma features, spectral contrast, MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), and zero-crossing rate. These features are then fed into a machine learning model to classify the modulation effect.

Feature Extraction Steps
Load Audio: Load the audio file using librosa.load().
Extract Features: Extract a range of audio features to capture the characteristics of modulation effects.
Chroma Features: Represent pitch classes across the spectrum.
MFCCs: Capture the timbral texture of the audio.
Spectral Contrast: Helps identify the harmonic structure.
Zero-Crossing Rate: Measures the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative, often affected by modulation.
Normalize Features: Standardize feature values to improve model performance.
Model Training
A supervised learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or CNN) is trained on labeled audio data with modulation effects. The model is evaluated on a validation set to ensure accuracy. After training, the model can classify modulation effects on new audio files.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
LibROSA
NumPy
scikit-learn
TensorFlow or PyTorch (if using deep learning models)
Jupyter (optional, for experimenting and visualization)
